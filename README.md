# SB-bot

## Purpose
Simple Python scripts made for learning purposes. Using Selenium and Statusbrew.com, they allow for semi-automated and targeted Twitter follow/defolow activities.
 **It's a learning project, the code if far from perfect. Feel free to improve it!**

## Disclaimer
* The defollow (unfollow.py) script is fully autonomous and can be ran with TaskScheduler/CRON jobs.
* The follow (follow.py) script still requires manual intervention, as I wanted to keep control over the targeted accounts for follower scraping.

## Requirements
* You'll need an account on [StatusBrew](https://www.statusBrew.com) to use the script.
* Selenium Python library is also required.
* [CALLR Python SDK](https://www.callr.com/docs/) is optional, if you want automated SMS reporting.
